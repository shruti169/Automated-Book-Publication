## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. The ocean roared behind him, its spray a frenzy whipped by the wind.  Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched—a vast, tranquil expanse of sapphire dotted with gulls. This breathtaking lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral reef, was his, or so it felt, though he’d only arrived yesterday.

The beach buzzed with activity. Women, children, and young people—his new people—worked under the scorching sun, mending nets, playing games, weaving intricate patterns on their *paraka* cloth.  Their canoes, beached on the sand, were his.  The empty houses, once home to war canoes, were his too.

His eyes shifted to the canoe sheds, a frown creasing his brow. He turned from the calm lagoon to face the crashing waves of the open ocean and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, unseen but ever-present, lay Palm Tree Island.  A paradise in his dreams, a reality of dangerous people.

Nearby, Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker's son, watched Dick intently.  Tari was young, but he understood the island's vulnerability. War had taken Karolin's men, leaving women, children, and boys defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, bringing Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed they were sent by the gods.

Tari, oblivious to such things, asked with childlike simplicity, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick hesitated. "Dick Lestrange" felt distant, a forgotten name, along with the language of his childhood.  His past was hazy, a half-remembered dream.  He’d arrived on Marua (Palm Tree Island) as a small boy with an old sailor named Kearney. Kearney had taught him to survive, to fish, and to build tiny ships—nothing like the Karolin canoes. Then Katafa had arrived, and together they’d escaped the Melanesians who'd seized the island, burning their ship and leaving only destruction.

He couldn't tell Tari this, not yet. The past was a blurry landscape, its details obscured by sun, storms, and rain. Only his time with Katafa on Marua felt clear, vivid. Even Kearney was fading, a ghost at the edge of his memory.  Only the tiny ships, Kearney's gifts, remained tangible reminders.

He looked down at Tari. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied. "I ask because I breathe. But grown-ups—*madyana*—never answer Tari's questions.  Ai, the fish!" He scampered off, drawn to children hauling in a net.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. Tari's question stirred something within him.  He saw the schooner engulfed in flames, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney's dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the villagers' welcoming—yet apprehensive—faces.  He was their chief, their leader.

But the memory of the Melanesians, the terror of their escape, tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. He wasn’t afraid of an immediate attack; the Melanesians lacked canoes. But he knew they would build them. They would see Karolin's glittering lagoon and come. It might be months, maybe years, but they would come.

Dick possessed a sharp mind. He could strategize, plan. He'd already sent a canoe for three master canoe-builders: Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. He’d also noticed the nearly one hundred young men nearing fighting age.  Underlying his preparations was his fierce love for Katafa—a love threatened by the shadow of Palm Tree.

War canoes.  Would he defend the lagoon, or take the fight to them?

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa, a stray lock of dark hair escaping her vine braid, stood beside him.  Her luminous dark eyes were fixed on the northern horizon.

"Look," she whispered.

Under certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, appeared through a mirage. They’d seen it last night, and now it was returning, slowly materializing from a faint smudge, growing clearer and sharper until the island emerged—beautiful and terrifying—shimmering on the horizon.

They stood together, silent, their untutored minds oblivious to the science of the mirage, their eyes glued to the island from which they’d fled.  They saw again the menacing figures, the terrifying escape, the screams. Before them stood the scene of their ordeal, its idyllic beauty masking the demons that still inhabited it.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They'd threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they still threatened her.

The vision of Palm Tree echoed his instinct: they would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and come. They had no women; Karolin did. The same instinct that had drawn him to Katafa would draw them to Karolin's women.  They would scan the horizon, searching for prey, guided by the lagoon's light.

He knew then that danger wasn’t only in the north; it lurked wherever greed, lust, or hate roamed the sea, not just among savages, but among "wolves of civilization" too.  His world was limited to the ocean surrounding the two islands. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history—only his life and Katafa's.  Yet they had learned to fear men, to understand the primal force that drove history: man’s instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree faded. As they turned, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the south. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders.  Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand to meet it.
