## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind.  But before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out—a vast, tranquil expanse of sapphire, dotted with fishing gulls. This breathtakingly beautiful lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral reef, was his.  He'd only arrived yesterday, yet it already felt like his own.

The beach buzzed with activity. Women, children, and young people – his people now – worked under the scorching sun.  They mended fishing nets, played games, and weaved intricate patterns on their *paraka* cloth.  Their canoes, pulled high on the sand, were his.  The empty houses, once home to war canoes, were his too.

His eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe sheds, a frown creasing his brow.  He turned his back on the calm water, facing the crashing waves of the open ocean and the northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, unseen but ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island.  A paradise in his dreams, but in reality, a place teeming with dangerous people.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker's son, sat nearby on the coral, watching Dick intently.  Tari was young, but he understood the island's vulnerability. War had taken the men of Karolin, leaving the women, children, and boys defenseless, leaderless.  Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago.  The women believed they were sent by the gods, destined to lead them.

Tari, oblivious to the concept of gods, looked at Dick with childlike simplicity and asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick couldn't simply answer.  The name "Dick Lestrange" felt distant, almost forgotten, along with the language of his childhood. The memories of his past were hazy, a half-remembered dream.  He’d arrived on Marua (Palm Tree Island) as a small boy with an old sailor named Kearney.  Kearney had taught him to survive, to fish, and even to build tiny ships—nothing like the Karolin canoes. Then Katafa had arrived, and together they’d escaped the brutal Melanesians who’d taken over the island, burning the ship and leaving only destruction in their wake.

He couldn’t tell Tari all this, not yet. The past was a blurry landscape, its details obscured by the intense tropical sun, the wild storms, and the heavy rains.  Only his time with Katafa on Marua felt clear, vivid. Even Kearney was fading from his memory, a ghost haunting the edges of his recollection.  Only the tiny ships, Kearney's gifts, remained as tangible reminders.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied. "I ask because I breathe. But grown-ups—*madyana*—never answer Tari's questions.  Ai, the fish!"  His attention shifted, drawn to children hauling in a net, and he scampered off.

Dick’s gaze returned to the north. Tari's question had stirred something within him. He saw again the schooner, engulfed in flames, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the welcoming—yet apprehensive—faces of the villagers.  He was their chief, their divinely appointed leader.

But the memory of the Melanesians, the terror of their escape, tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.  He wasn’t afraid of an immediate attack; the Melanesians lacked canoes. But he knew they would build them.  They would see the glittering reflection of the Karolin lagoon—just as he had—and they would come.  It might be months, maybe years, but they would come.

Dick, though essentially a native, possessed a sharp mind – a white man's thinking. He could strategize, plan ahead, anticipate.  That's why he’d sent a canoe to fetch three master canoe-builders, Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. That's why he'd noticed the nearly one hundred young men nearing fighting age.  And underlying all his preparations, fueling his determination, was his fierce love for Katafa—a love threatened, however subtly, by the shadow of Palm Tree.

War canoes.  Would he defend the lagoon, or would he take the fight to them?  He wasn't sure yet.

A hand touched his shoulder.  He turned to see Katafa, a stray lock of her dark hair escaping its vine braid, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous dark eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, the same direction as his gaze.

"Look," she whispered.

Under certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, appeared through a mirage.  They'd seen it last night, and now it was returning, slowly materializing from a faint smudge in the sky, growing clearer and sharper, until the island emerged—beautiful and terrifying—a dreamlike vision shimmering on the horizon.

They stood together, silent, their untutored minds oblivious to the science of the mirage, their eyes glued to the island from which they'd fled. They saw again the menacing figures of the savages, the terrifying escape, the screams of the Melanesians.  Before them stood the scene of their ordeal, its idyllic beauty masking the demons that still inhabited it.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred.  They’d threatened him—that was nothing.  They'd threatened Katafa—that was everything.  And they still threatened her.

The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo his instinct: they would build canoes, they would see the lagoon’s reflection, and they would come. They had no women; Karolin did. The same instinct that had drawn him to Katafa would draw them to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for prey, and the lagoon light would guide them.

He knew then that danger wasn’t just in the north, it lurked wherever greed, lust, or hate roamed the azure sea; not just among savages, but among the "wolves of civilization" too.  For Dick, the world was limited to the ocean that surrounded the two islands.  He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history—only his life and Katafa's. Yet even in their brief lives, they had learned to fear men, to understand the primal force that drove all of history: man’s instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing as quickly as a snuffed candle.  As they turned from the sea, Katafa pointed towards a canoe approaching from the south.  It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand to meet it.
