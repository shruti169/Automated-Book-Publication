    "## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder\n\nDick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Before him, the tranquil lagoon of Karolin stretched\u2014a vast expanse of sapphire dotted with fishing gulls. This breathtaking lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral reef, felt like his own, even though he\u2019d only arrived yesterday.\n\nThe beach buzzed with activity.  His people\u2014women, children, and young men\u2014worked under the scorching sun, mending fishing nets, playing games, and weaving intricate patterns onto their *paraka* cloth. Their canoes, pulled high on the sand, were his. The empty houses, once home to war canoes, were his too.\n\nHis eyes flicked from the lagoon to the canoe sheds, a frown creasing his brow. He turned from the calm water to face the crashing waves of the open ocean and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, unseen but ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island\u2014a paradise in his dreams, but a place teeming with dangerous people in reality.\n\nNearby, young Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker\u2019s son, watched Dick intently. Though young, Tari understood the island\u2019s vulnerability. War had taken Karolin\u2019s men, leaving the women, children, and boys defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed they were sent by the gods, destined to lead them.\n\nTari, oblivious to gods, looked at Dick with childlike simplicity and asked, \"Taori, who are you?\"\n\nDick couldn't simply answer.  The name \"Dick Lestrange\" felt distant, almost forgotten, along with the language of his childhood. His past memories were hazy, like a half-remembered dream. He\u2019d arrived on Marua (Palm Tree Island) as a small boy with an old sailor named Kearney. Kearney had taught him to survive, fish, and even build tiny ships\u2014nothing like the Karolin canoes. Then Katafa had arrived, and together they\u2019d escaped the brutal Melanesians who\u2019d overrun the island, burning the ship and leaving only destruction.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t tell Tari all this, not yet. The past was a blurry landscape, its details obscured by the intense sun, wild storms, and heavy rains. Only his time with Katafa on Marua felt clear, vivid. Even Kearney was fading, a ghost at the edges of his memory. Only the tiny ships, Kearney\u2019s gifts, remained as tangible reminders.\n\nHe looked down at the curious child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tari replied. \"I ask because I breathe. But grown-ups\u2014*madyana*\u2014never answer Tari\u2019s questions. Ai, the fish!\" His attention shifted to children hauling in a net, and he scampered off.\n\nDick\u2019s gaze returned to the north. Tari\u2019s question stirred something within him. He saw again the burning schooner, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney\u2019s old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the welcoming\u2014yet apprehensive\u2014faces of the villagers. He was their chief, their divinely appointed leader.\n\nBut the memory of the Melanesians, the terror of their escape, tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. He wasn\u2019t afraid of an immediate attack; the Melanesians lacked canoes. But he knew they would build them. They would see the glittering reflection of the Karolin lagoon\u2014as he had\u2014and they would come. It might be months, maybe years, but they would come.\n\nDick, essentially a native but with a white man\u2019s sharp mind, could strategize, plan, and anticipate. That\u2019s why he\u2019d sent a canoe to fetch three master canoe-builders: Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. That\u2019s why he\u2019d noticed the nearly one hundred young men nearing fighting age. And underlying all his preparations, fueling his determination, was his fierce love for Katafa\u2014a love subtly threatened by the shadow of Palm Tree Island.\n\nWar canoes. Would he defend the lagoon, or take the fight to them? He wasn\u2019t sure yet.\n\nA hand touched his shoulder. He turned to see Katafa; a stray lock of her dark hair, escaping its vine braid, fluttered in the breeze like an eagle\u2019s feather. Her luminous dark eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, mirroring his gaze.\n\n\"Look,\" she whispered.\n\nUnder certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree Island, though far beyond the horizon, appeared through a mirage. They\u2019d seen it last night, and now it was returning, slowly materializing from a faint smudge in the sky, growing clearer and sharper, until the island emerged\u2014beautiful and terrifying\u2014a dreamlike vision shimmering on the horizon.\n\nThey stood together, silent, their untutored minds oblivious to the science of the mirage, their eyes glued to the island from which they\u2019d fled. They saw again the menacing figures of the savages, the terrifying escape, the screams of the Melanesians. Before them stood the scene of their ordeal, its idyllic beauty masking the demons that still inhabited it.\n\nDick\u2019s nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They\u2019d threatened him\u2014that was nothing. They\u2019d threatened Katafa\u2014that was everything. And they still threatened her.\n\nThe vision of Palm Tree Island echoed his instinct: they would build canoes, they would see the lagoon\u2019s reflection, and they would come. They had no women; Karolin did. The same instinct that had drawn him to Katafa would draw them to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for prey, and the lagoon\u2019s light would guide them.\n\nHe knew then that danger wasn\u2019t just in the north; it lurked wherever greed, lust, or hate roamed the azure sea; not just among savages, but among the \"wolves of civilization\" too. For Dick, the world was limited to the ocean surrounding the two islands. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history\u2014only his life and Katafa\u2019s. Yet even in their brief lives, they had learned to fear men, to understand the primal force that drove all of history: man\u2019s instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.\n\nSlowly, the vision of Palm Tree Island began to fade, vanishing as quickly as a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea, Katafa pointed towards a canoe approaching from the south. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand to meet it.\n"
