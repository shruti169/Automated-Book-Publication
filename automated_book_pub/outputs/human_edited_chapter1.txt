## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Before him, the tranquil lagoon of Karolin stretched—a vast expanse of sapphire dotted with fishing gulls. This breathtaking lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral reef, felt like his own, even though he’d only arrived yesterday.

The beach buzzed with activity.  His people—women, children, and young men—worked under the scorching sun, mending fishing nets, playing games, and weaving intricate patterns onto their *paraka* cloth. Their canoes, pulled high on the sand, were his. The empty houses, once home to war canoes, were his too.

His eyes flicked from the lagoon to the canoe sheds, a frown creasing his brow. He turned from the calm water to face the crashing waves of the open ocean and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, unseen but ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise in his dreams, but a place teeming with dangerous people in reality.

Nearby, young Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker’s son, watched Dick intently. Though young, Tari understood the island’s vulnerability. War had taken Karolin’s men, leaving the women, children, and boys defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed they were sent by the gods, destined to lead them.

Tari, oblivious to gods, looked at Dick with childlike simplicity and asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick couldn't simply answer.  The name "Dick Lestrange" felt distant, almost forgotten, along with the language of his childhood. His past memories were hazy, like a half-remembered dream. He’d arrived on Marua (Palm Tree Island) as a small boy with an old sailor named Kearney. Kearney had taught him to survive, fish, and even build tiny ships—nothing like the Karolin canoes. Then Katafa had arrived, and together they’d escaped the brutal Melanesians who’d overrun the island, burning the ship and leaving only destruction.

He couldn’t tell Tari all this, not yet. The past was a blurry landscape, its details obscured by the intense sun, wild storms, and heavy rains. Only his time with Katafa on Marua felt clear, vivid. Even Kearney was fading, a ghost at the edges of his memory. Only the tiny ships, Kearney’s gifts, remained as tangible reminders.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied. "I ask because I breathe. But grown-ups—*madyana*—never answer Tari’s questions. Ai, the fish!" His attention shifted to children hauling in a net, and he scampered off.

Dick’s gaze returned to the north. Tari’s question stirred something within him. He saw again the burning schooner, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney’s old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the welcoming—yet apprehensive—faces of the villagers. He was their chief, their divinely appointed leader.

But the memory of the Melanesians, the terror of their escape, tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. He wasn’t afraid of an immediate attack; the Melanesians lacked canoes. But he knew they would build them. They would see the glittering reflection of the Karolin lagoon—as he had—and they would come. It might be months, maybe years, but they would come.

Dick, essentially a native but with a white man’s sharp mind, could strategize, plan, and anticipate. That’s why he’d sent a canoe to fetch three master canoe-builders: Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. That’s why he’d noticed the nearly one hundred young men nearing fighting age. And underlying all his preparations, fueling his determination, was his fierce love for Katafa—a love subtly threatened by the shadow of Palm Tree Island.

War canoes. Would he defend the lagoon, or take the fight to them? He wasn’t sure yet.

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned to see Katafa; a stray lock of her dark hair, escaping its vine braid, fluttered in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous dark eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, mirroring his gaze.

"Look," she whispered.

Under certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree Island, though far beyond the horizon, appeared through a mirage. They’d seen it last night, and now it was returning, slowly materializing from a faint smudge in the sky, growing clearer and sharper, until the island emerged—beautiful and terrifying—a dreamlike vision shimmering on the horizon.

They stood together, silent, their untutored minds oblivious to the science of the mirage, their eyes glued to the island from which they’d fled. They saw again the menacing figures of the savages, the terrifying escape, the screams of the Melanesians. Before them stood the scene of their ordeal, its idyllic beauty masking the demons that still inhabited it.

Dick’s nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They’d threatened him—that was nothing. They’d threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they still threatened her.

The vision of Palm Tree Island echoed his instinct: they would build canoes, they would see the lagoon’s reflection, and they would come. They had no women; Karolin did. The same instinct that had drawn him to Katafa would draw them to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for prey, and the lagoon’s light would guide them.

He knew then that danger wasn’t just in the north; it lurked wherever greed, lust, or hate roamed the azure sea; not just among savages, but among the "wolves of civilization" too. For Dick, the world was limited to the ocean surrounding the two islands. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history—only his life and Katafa’s. Yet even in their brief lives, they had learned to fear men, to understand the primal force that drove all of history: man’s instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree Island began to fade, vanishing as quickly as a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea, Khhhatafa pointed towards a canoe approaching from the south. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand to meet it.
